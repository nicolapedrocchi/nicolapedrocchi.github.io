Motion Planning For Human-Robot Cooperation
------

Step-changes in safety technologies have opened robotic cells to human workers in real industrial scenarios. However, the lack of methodologies for productive and effective motion planning and scheduling of human-robot cooperative (HRC) tasks still limits the spread of HRC systems. Standard methods fail due to the high variability of the robot execution time, which is caused by the need to modify the robot's motion to ensure continuous human safety.
In this context, my research ambitions are multiple.
First, to deploy better and innovative motion planners both for robot arms and mobile manipulators, able to exploit the human behavior models to increase the ergonomics and safety togheter with the robot system productivity.
Second, to better integrate the motion planning with the task and motion planning to optimize not just locally the execution of one task, but the entire process.

Physical Human-Robot Interaction
------

The industry needs controllers that allow smooth and natural physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) to make production scenarios more flexible and user-friendly.
Within this context, my research have been focused over the years on multiple methodologies. Starting from the development of adaptive impedance controllers, I then moved to Role Arbitration methodologies, which are the mechanism that assigns the role of the leader to either the human or the robot. My team and I investigated deeply the adoption of the Game-Theory (GT) to model pHRI, and specifically, Cooperative Game Theory (CGT) and Non-Cooperative Game Theory (NCGT). In such a context, we also investigated how to model the human behavior and intention when interacting with the robot.

Human-Robot Safe Interaction
------

Activities Development of control algorithms for collision avoidance
and online rescheduling based on the estimated position of people
within the robot's operating space. Development of methodologies for
functional safety certification of non-certified sensor networks.

Robotized Processes And Control
------

Investigation on adopting industrial robots for additive and
traditional technologies and processes. Laser-based direct metal
deposition (LBDMD) is a promising additive manufacturing technology
well suited for producing complex metal structures, low-volume
manufacturing, and high-value component repair or modification. It
finds broad application in the automotive, biomedical, and aerospace
industries. The research focuses on optimizing path planning when
redundant axes (robot + external axes) are present, and the
operations are only partially constrained in Cartesian space.
Furthermore, the integrated control of the robot's motion and the
process may dramatically increase the results in additive and
subtractive technologies. The research also investigates
methodologies on virtual sensors that exploit the knowledge of
hindsight robots about the process.

Elasto-Dynamics Modelling And Control
------

The attempt to use industrial robots for technological and
interaction tasks, i.e., robotic machining and automatic assembling,
implies, on the one hand, the knowledge of the interaction force, on
the other hand, the reduction of physical sensors. The research aims
to define the best models with lumped parameters (both rigid and
elastodynamic models) to predict the behavior of a manipulator's
cups during the execution of generic trajectories. Integration of
advanced models in robust/optimal adaptive controls. Furthermore,
this work aims to develop a virtual force sensor to estimate the
interaction force.

Rehabilitation Robotics
------

The increasing interest from the medical rehabilitation world
towards robotic technologies to recover neuromotor functions has led
to the development of the Rehabilitation Multi-Sensory Room
(RehaMSR), a multisensory robotic platform to be used as an aid to
neuromotor rehabilitation for the execution of rehabilitation
exercises. This platform consists of hardware and software
components coordinated by a central control system, interacting with
the patient and adapting to it.

Robot Kinematics Analysis And Synthesis
-------

Research in the optimum design has taken different directions. One
of those was to define the kinematic or dynamic parameters that
determine the characteristics of the manipulator to justify the best
design. In most of the studies underway, the possible solutions are
restricted to one feasible region in which all geometrical and
dynamic restrictions and the drives' power input must be met. The
research aims to investigate solutions through an energy approach
where redundant actuation and elastic elements in the chain achieve
the optimum design in a multiple-link system.

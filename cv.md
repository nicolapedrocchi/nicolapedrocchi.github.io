# Research Interest {#research-interest .unnumbered}

Elasto-Dynamics Modelling And Control

:   The attempt to use industrial robots for technological and
    interaction tasks, i.e., robotic machining and automatic assembling,
    implies, on the one hand, the knowledge of the interaction force, on
    the other hand, the reduction of physical sensors. The research aims
    to define the best models with lumped parameters (both rigid and
    elastodynamic models) to predict the behavior of a manipulator's
    cups during the execution of generic trajectories. Integration of
    advanced models in robust/optimal adaptive controls. Furthermore,
    this work aims to develop a virtual force sensor to estimate the
    interaction force.

Force And Impedance Control

:   The research focuses on force-tracking impedance controllers
    granting a free-overshoots contact force (mandatory performance for
    many critical interaction tasks such as polishing) for partially
    unknown interacting environments (such as leather or hard-fragile
    materials). The robot has to gently approach the target environment
    (whose position is usually not well-known) and then execute the
    interaction task. The research deals with free space approaching
    motion and succeeding contact tasks without switching from different
    control logics.

Robotized Processes And Control

:   Investigation on adopting industrial robots for additive and
    traditional technologies and processes. Laser-based direct metal
    deposition (LBDMD) is a promising additive manufacturing technology
    well suited for producing complex metal structures, low-volume
    manufacturing, and high-value component repair or modification. It
    finds broad application in the automotive, biomedical, and aerospace
    industries. The research focuses on optimizing path planning when
    redundant axes (robot + external axes) are present, and the
    operations are only partially constrained in Cartesian space.
    Furthermore, the integrated control of the robot's motion and the
    process may dramatically increase the results in additive and
    subtractive technologies. The research also investigates
    methodologies on virtual sensors that exploit the knowledge of
    hindsight robots about the process.

Lead-Through Programming

:   Human-robot cooperation is increasingly demanded in industrial
    applications. Many tasks require the robot to enhance the
    capabilities of humans, allowing them to execute onerous tasks or
    improve their functionalities. Besides wearable robotics, standard
    industrial manipulators are common solutions to empower humans. The
    research focuses on control approaches for assisting human operators
    in demanding industrial applications. The methodologies focused on
    the mechatronic design of new devices (up to 2015) and then on
    control strategies to ease the Cartesian lead through the
    programming of the standard collaborative robot (with
    fully-sensorised joints)

Robot Kinematics Analysis And Synthesis

:   Research in the optimum design has taken different directions. One
    of those was to define the kinematic or dynamic parameters that
    determine the characteristics of the manipulator to justify the best
    design. In most of the studies underway, the possible solutions are
    restricted to one feasible region in which all geometrical and
    dynamic restrictions and the drives' power input must be met. The
    research aims to investigate solutions through an energy approach
    where redundant actuation and elastic elements in the chain achieve
    the optimum design in a multiple-link system.

Motion Planning For Human-Robot Cooperation

:   Step-changes in safety technologies have opened robotic cells to
    human workers in real industrial scenarios. However, the lack of
    methodologies for productive and effective motion planning and
    scheduling of human-robot cooperative (HRC) tasks still limits the
    spread of HRC systems. Standard methods fail due to the high
    variability of the robot execution time, which is caused by the need
    to modify the robot's motion to ensure continuous human safety. In
    this context, the research focuses on motion planning and scheduling
    methodology that (i) provides a set of robot trajectories for each
    task and (ii) optimizes, at appropriate time steps, a task plan,
    minimizing the cycle time through trajectory selection, task
    sequence, and task allocation. Statistical offline methods are
    deeply investigated.

Rehabilitation Robotics

:   The increasing interest from the medical rehabilitation world
    towards robotic technologies to recover neuromotor functions has led
    to the development of the Rehabilitation Multi-Sensory Room
    (RehaMSR), a multisensory robotic platform to be used as an aid to
    neuromotor rehabilitation for the execution of rehabilitation
    exercises. This platform consists of hardware and software
    components coordinated by a central control system, interacting with
    the patient and adapting to it.

Human-Robot Safe Interaction

:   Activities Development of control algorithms for collision avoidance
    and online rescheduling based on the estimated position of people
    within the robot's operating space. Development of methodologies for
    functional safety certification of non-certified sensor networks.
